After it was finally passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Bill was signed into Law by Former President Corazon C. Aquino on April 2, 1992 as Republic Act No. 7352 also known as "An Act Converting the present Camarines Norte National High School in the Municipality of Daet into a State College to be known as the Camarines Norte State College (CNSC) integrating for the purpose the Abaño Pilot Elementary School in Daet, Mercedes School of Fisheries in Mercedes, National Agricultural School in Labo, and Camarines Norte School of Arts and Trades in Jose Panganiban all in the province of Camarines Norte and appropriating funds thereof."</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">As an aspiring educator, I am committed to fostering a classroom environment where students are active participants in their own learning journeys. My teaching philosophy is grounded in the principles of constructivism, which emphasizes that learners construct knowledge through meaningful experiences, collaboration, and reflection.<br><br>
            I believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to explore, question, and connect new ideas to their prior knowledge. In my classroom, I strive to create opportunities for hands-on activities, open-ended discussions, and real-world problem-solving. By acting as a facilitator and guide, I support my students as they take ownership of their learning, develop critical thinking skills, and grow into lifelong learners.<br>             <br>
            This portfolio showcases my experiences, lesson plans, and reflections as a pre-service teacher. It is a testament to my dedication to creating a dynamic, inclusive, and student-centered learning environment where every learner is empowered to reach their full potential.</p>
